# Five Nights at Freddy's 1 (Camera View) Wallpaper

All in-game sprites/sounds credits goes towards [Scott Cawthon](https://scottgames.com/), from [Five Nights at Freddy's](https://store.steampowered.com/app/319510/Five_Nights_at_Freddys/).

This contains the very work that I've provided towards the Five Nights at Freddy's 1 camera view wallpapers that I've made ages ago, in GameMaker. As GameMaker has improved over the years and HTML5 has become more problematic for me over time, I haven't chosen to expand much beyond it. I plan in the future in remaking the Five Nights at Freddy's 1 (Camera View) under Web Assembly (along with all future wallpapers. Also the codebase isn't particularly the happiest I'm with, but it is what it is). I hereby give free permission to view, modify, experiment, add, remove, at will. 

## This project was last used under version IDE 2024.4.1.152 Runtime 2024.4.1.202, compiled strictly for HTML5 for Wallpaper Engine and Lively Wallpaper.
You may find the wallpapers available from here.
